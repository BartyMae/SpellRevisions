When a druid casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding her. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two levels of the caster. For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against her but the sixth would affect her normally. The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.  
  
It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of inflicting some type of elemental damage can still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
