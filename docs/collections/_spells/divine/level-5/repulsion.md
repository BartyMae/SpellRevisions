An invisible, mobile field surrounds the caster and prevents creatures from approaching him. Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save vs. spell at -4 penalty. If it fails, it gets pushed away by 10 feet. Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons.
