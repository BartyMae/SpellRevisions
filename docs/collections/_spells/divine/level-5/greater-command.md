Greater Command  
Level: 5  
School: Enchantment  
Sphere: Charm, Combat, Law  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 20'  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
As with the first level spell Command, this spell enables the priest to command other creatures to lie down and take no action (sleep), but the effects of this spell last up to 10 rounds, and every enemy within 20 feet of the target is affected (save vs. spell at -4 negates). At the start of each round after the first, those affected get another save to attempt to break free from the spell. When the spell duration expires, any creatures still sleeping will awaken.
