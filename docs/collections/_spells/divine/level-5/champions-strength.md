When this spell is cast, the priest draws on the power of his god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target gains a bonus to strength, dexterity, and constitution scores at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster, up to a maximum bonus of 6 at 18th level. The effect lasts for 1 round for every level of the caster or until dispelled. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar spells.
