When a Protection from Fire spell is cast, the recipient receives complete protection from fire-based attacks, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the damage from attacks like fiery dragon breath will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of spells such as Burning Hands, Fireball, Flame Strike, and Fire Storm. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
