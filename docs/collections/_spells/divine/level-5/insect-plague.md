Insect Plague  
Level: 5  
School: Conjuration  
Sphere: Animal  
Range: Long  
Duration: 6 rounds  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When this spell is cast, a mass of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm, first attacking the target, and then moving on to all enemies of the caster within the spell's radius.  
  
For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round the victims suffer 2d3 points of damage from insect bites, and have a 100% chance of spell failure. If a successful save vs. breath at -2 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
