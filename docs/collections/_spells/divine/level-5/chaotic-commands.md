While under the effects of this spell, the recipient becomes immune to magical commands. Charm, Command, Confusion, Domination, Hold, and Sleep are all spells that fit into this category. This spell also protects from psionic mind attacks such as a mind flayer's Psionic Blast, but it will not confer complete immunity to psionics. This effect will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
