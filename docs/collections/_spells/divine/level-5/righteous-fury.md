This is a powerful combat spell that enhances the priest's physical prowess, charging him with positive energy and transforming him into a juggernaut of destruction. The caster's strength is augmented by 4 points, his armor class is improved by 2 points, and he gains 1 temporary hit point for every level he has attained (up to a maximum of 20). Furthermore, the caster deals an additional 1d6 points of magic damage whenever he strikes an opponent with a melee weapon. The effects last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
