When a Protection from Cold spell is cast, the recipient receives complete protection from cold-based attacks, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the damage from attacks like icy dragon breath will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of spells such as Ice Storm and Cone of Cold. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
