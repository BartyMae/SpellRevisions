(Conjuration)  
  
Level: Quest  
Sphere: Summoning  
Range: 40 ft.  
Duration: 3 rounds  
Casting Time: 8  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius   
Saving Throw: Special  
  
Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 3d8 points of magic damage per round for the next 3 rounds (no save). In addition, all living enemies (undead and constructs are unaffected) must save vs. Spell or lose 2 points of Strength every round for 5 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative, but this spell cannot reduce the Strength of a creature below 1.
