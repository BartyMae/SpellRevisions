Globe of Blades  
Level: Quest  
School: Evocation  
Sphere: Guardian, Creation  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: 6' radius  
Saving Throw: None  
  
The priest employs this spell to create a globe of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, forming a dangerous and impenetrable barrier. Those within a 6 foot radius of the caster suffer 2d10 points of damage every 2 seconds (save vs. breath at -6 negates). The barrier also provides the caster with a +4 armor class bonus. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.  
  
Note that spells like Invisibility, Shadow Door, etc. will not function on the caster when protected by Globe of Blades. Also, cleric/thieves and cleric/rangers who cast this will not be able to hide in shadows until the spell expires.
