Harnessing the power of the earth, this powerful shapechange ability allows the druid to become a greater earth elemental of considerable power. The caster gains the natural attacks of the elemental form, as well as all of his natural protections and abilities. The druid's mental attributes are not affected, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. All clothes and equipment he was wearing will mold into the new form and continue to function, unseen. When the druid returns to his natural form, they will also return to their previous state.
