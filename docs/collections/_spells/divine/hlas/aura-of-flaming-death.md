This spell causes the caster to be enveloped by an aura of intense flame that both injures opponents and protects from damage. This shield not only grants the user 100% fire resistance and protects him from all non-magical weapons, but can also damage creatures within a 5 foot radius around him and enflame weapons held by the caster. Any opponent that hits the caster with a weapon or spell from within this radius suffers 2d10+2 fire damage, and whenever the caster strikes an opponent with a melee weapon, he deals an additional 1d10 points of fire damage.
