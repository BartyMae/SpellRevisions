When a Negative Plane Protection spell is cast, the recipient receives complete protection from negative energy attacks. This spell also affords the recipient partial protection from monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain levels. A protected creature is immune to any form of level draining for the duration of the spell, though they will still suffer normal hit point damage from the physical attacks, if applicable.
