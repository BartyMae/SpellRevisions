Through this spell, the caster can poison a single victim. The damage dealt by the poison depends upon the level of the priest casting the spell.  
  
7th level:  4d4  +  1 every 4 seconds  
9th level:  5d5  +  1 every 3 seconds  
12th level:  6d6  +  1 every 2 seconds  
15th+ level:  8d8  +  1 every 1 second  
  
The victim cannot avoid the initial damage unless it is completely immune to the effects of poison, but a successful save vs. poison at -2 will negate the ongoing damage.
