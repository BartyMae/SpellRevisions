When cast upon a subject, he must make a save vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the priest entering his mind. The effects of this spell are similar to the 5th level wizard spell Domination, with a few minor differences. Most notably, this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell duration. To control the subject, the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. This control will last until dispelled or for the duration of the spell.
