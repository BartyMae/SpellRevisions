Sunray  
Level: 7  
School: Evocation  
Sphere: Sun  
Range: Personal  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 30' radius  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When this spell is cast, it causes a ray of sunlight to beam down upon the caster and a globe of searing radiance to explode in a 30 foot radius. All hostile creatures in the area of effect are blinded for 10 rounds and take 6d6 points of damage. Undead creatures caught within the sunburst instead take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (up to a maximum of 20d6). A successful save vs. breath at a -4 penalty negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half. The burst also results in the destruction of all undead creatures specifically harmed by bright light (such as vampires, shadows, and wraiths) that fail a saving throw vs. spell.
