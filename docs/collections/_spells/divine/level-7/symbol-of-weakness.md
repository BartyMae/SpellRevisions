Symbol of Weakness is a powerful enchantment that allows the caster to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, at which point it is triggered and explodes, causing all enemies within a 20 foot radius to make a saving throw vs. spell at -4 or have their strength, dexterity, and constitution reduced by 4. The spell effects will persist until the character receives a Cure Disease spell.
