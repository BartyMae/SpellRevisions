Earthquake  
Level: 7  
School: Alteration  
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)  
Range: Long  
Duration: 3 rounds  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: 30' radius  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips the ground. Once every round for the spell's duration, a tremor will take place, affecting all creatures in its area of effect. Earth elementals and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell.  
  
There are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake. The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6d6 points of damage (save vs. paralyzation at -6 for half damage). Those who fail their saving throw fall to the ground unconscious for 2 rounds. The second tremor is less severe, causing 4d6 points of damage (save vs. death at -4 for half), but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth, which all affected creatures have a 20% chance to fall into and die (save vs. breath at -4 negates). The final tremor causes 2d6 damage (save vs. death at -2 for half) and there is a 10% chance affected creatures will be trapped within the fissures, causing death (save vs. breath at -2 negates). Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to try to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.  
  
This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
