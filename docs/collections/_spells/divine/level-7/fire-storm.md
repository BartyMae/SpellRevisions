Fire Storm  
Level: 7  
School: Evocation  
Sphere: Combat, Elemental (Fire)  
Range: Long  
Duration: 4 rounds  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: 30' radius  
Saving Throw: Breath half  
  
When a Fire Storm spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame and then pelted with fiery balls of lava. Those caught in the inferno receive 2d8 points of damage plus one for each level of the caster (up to a maximum of 2d8+20). This assault will last for four rounds, continuing to damage all creatures who remain within the area of effect. An area 10 feet around the caster will be protected from the onslaught. Creatures who successfully save vs. breath at a -4 penalty take only half damage.
