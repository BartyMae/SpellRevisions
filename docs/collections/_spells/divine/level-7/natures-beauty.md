When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation. The caster becomes the very ideal of beauty, for a male, this is usually a nymph or a dryad, for a female, the image varies. Any humanoid viewing the illusion must save vs. spell at a -4 penalty or be charmed for 10 rounds. The transformation is instantaneous, but lasts only seconds, affecting those in the area but excluding fellow party members.  
  
If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, a charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon a charmed creature, the charm is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.
