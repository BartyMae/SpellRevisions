A Greater Restoration spell removes most temporary and permanent negative effects from the target creature. It reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature caused by any force, spell, or monster. It can restore a polymorphed or petrified creature to its natural form, break the effects of a curse, reverse unnatural mental states such as confusion, feeblemindedness, and berserk rages, and free the recipient from magical effects like fear, paralysis, sleep, and stun. This potent spell will also restore any lost hit points and cure the target of any diseases or poisons.  
  
The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, leaving him physically and mentally exhausted. For 5 rounds after the spell is cast, the priest will suffer a -2 penalty to hit, damage, armor class, and casting speed factor.
