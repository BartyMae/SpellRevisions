Creeping Doom  
Level: 7  
School: Conjuration  
Sphere: Animal  
Range: Long  
Duration: 6 rounds  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, he calls forth a horde of venomous biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target.  
  
For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round the victims suffer 2d3 points of damage from insect bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death at -2 or be poisoned. If a successful save vs. breath at -4 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty. Poisoned creatures suffer additional 6 points of damage each round for 3 rounds or until cured. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
