Symbol of Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the caster to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, at which point it is triggered and explodes, causing all enemies within a 20 foot radius to make a saving throw vs. death at -4 or die. Creatures with more than 60 current hit points are immune to this effect.
