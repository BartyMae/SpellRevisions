Ether Gate  
(Alteration)  
  
Level: 7  
Sphere: Travelers  
Range: Touch   
Duration: 5 rounds  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell transports one creature, chosen by the caster, to the Ethereal Plane. The creature vanishes for the spell's duration, at which point it returns to the physical world in the exact same spot where it was before. While in the Ethereal Plane, the victim cannot interact with anyone or anything that resides on the Prime Material Plane. There is no saving throw against this spell, though it is subject to magic resistance. Friendly creatures can lower their magic resistance so that the shaman can target them with this spell. In addition, Ether Gate is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against maze effects.
