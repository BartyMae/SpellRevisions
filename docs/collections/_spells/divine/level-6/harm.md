This spell is the reverse of Heal. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell inflicts 90 points of damage upon the target. Harm cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1. The spell expires once the priest makes a successful melee attack or after 1 turn has passed. The priest gains a +4 bonus to hit the target. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
