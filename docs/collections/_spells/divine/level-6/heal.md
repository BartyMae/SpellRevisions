The very potent Heal spell enables the priest to wipe away any injury in the creature who receives its benefits. It completely cures the recipient of all diseases, poisons, and conditions such as blindness and deafness. It heals all points of damage suffered due to wounds or injury and dispels a Feeblemind spell. Naturally, the effects can be negated by later wounds, injuries, and diseases.
