Blade Barrier  
Level: 6

The priest employs this spell to create a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, forming a dangerous barrier. Those within a 6 foot radius of the caster suffer 1d8 points of slashing damage every 3 seconds. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.  
  
Note that spells like Invisibility, Shadow Door, etc. will not function on the caster when protected by Blade Barrier. Also, cleric/thieves and cleric/rangers who cast this will not be able to hide in shadows until the spell expires.
