Sol's Searing Orb  
Level: 6  
School: Conjuration  
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 3 rounds  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: Breath partial  
  
When the spell is completed, it creates a glowing gem. This gem must be thrown at an opponent within 3 rounds, or it will become too hot to hold. When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 12d6 points of fire damage to anyone within 30 feet. Creatures within the burst are allowed a saving throw vs. breath at -4 penalty. If successful, only half damage is sustained. On a failed save, the victim also suffers -2 penalty to thac0 and 1d6 points of fire damage each round for 6 rounds. It is not possible for the priest to give the stone to another character to throw. Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.
