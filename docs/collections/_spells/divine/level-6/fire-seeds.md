This spell enables the druid to create a number of fire seeds, one for every 2 experience levels the druid has attained (up to a maximum of 10 fire seeds at 20th level). When thrown at an enemy, these will explode into small fireballs, causing 4d6 points of damage to all within a 10 foot radius (save vs. breath at -4 for half damage). The seeds are treated as missiles hurled by the caster with a +4 bonus to the attack roll and each has an enchantment level of +4. These seeds will appear in the caster's hands and remain in existence for 5 turns. The druid may discharge up to five of them per round.
