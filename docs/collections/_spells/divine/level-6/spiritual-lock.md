The target of Spiritual Lock must Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty or have its mind temporarily sealed away within the spirit world. During this time, the victim is unable to perform any actions that require conscious thought such as attacking, using items, or casting spells. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty instead of -2. Spiritual Lock is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against feeblemind effects.
