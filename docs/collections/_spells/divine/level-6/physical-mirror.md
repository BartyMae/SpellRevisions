This spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the form of an invisible disk that protects the caster but also distorts his appearence as if a mirrored image of the caster traveled alongside him. Any missile attack that intersects the disk is instantaneously deflected, while there is a 50% chance that a melee attacker will attack the mirrored image and a 50% chance that he will attack the caster.
