When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of his opponents to ignore his existence, as if he were invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells focused on himself or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal his wounds, for example, or to cast a Chant spell. He cannot cast spells on other targets without ending the spell.
