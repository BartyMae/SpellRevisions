Resist Fear  
Level: 1

Range: Long  
Duration: 5 turns  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 30' radius  
Saving Throw: None  
  
The caster instills courage in the spell recipients, raising their morale to its highest. If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated. In addition, the recipients are protected from magical fear for the duration of the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).
