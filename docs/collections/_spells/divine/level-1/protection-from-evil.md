When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: first, all attacks made by evil creatures against the protected creature receive a -2 penalty to their attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.
