Calling upon the strength of the earth, the caster gains some of the solidity and strength of stone. This spell sets the strength of the character to 18 and then adds 50 exceptional strength on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 strength, then his strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then his strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If his strength is less then 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's strength if it is already 19 or more. For the duration of the spell, the caster also becomes immune to everything, magical or otherwise, that pushes him away (e.g. wing buffets, gusts of wind, telekinesis, etc.), but will move at a reduced speed.
