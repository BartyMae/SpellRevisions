This spell enables the caster to create a magical cudgel. The shillelagh inflicts 2d4+1 points of damage on a successful hit and causes tendrils to wrap around and hold the victim in place for one round unless a save vs. breath is made. The caster wields the shillelagh as if proficient with the weapon, at his normal THAC0. At level 1, it functions as a magical weapon with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every other four experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +3 enchantment level, +3 to attack rolls, and +3 to damage for a 9th-level caster. The shillelagh can be used only by the caster, and remains in his hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
