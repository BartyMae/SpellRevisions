When this spell is cast, a brilliant ray of scorching heat slants down from the sky and strikes one target of the caster's choice. The creature struck by the ray sustains 2d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 every two extra levels of experience (up to a maximum of 6d6). Undead creatures and monsters vulnerable to bright light suffer double damage (up to a maximum of 12d6). If the target successfully rolls a saving throw vs. breath he will receive only half damage. In addition to sustaining damage, victims who fail their saves are blinded for 1 round.
