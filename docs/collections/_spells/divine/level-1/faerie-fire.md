Faerie Fire  
Level: 1  
School: Evocation  
Sphere: Weather  
Range: Long  
Duration: 4 rounds  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 5' radius  
Saving Throw: Spell negates  
  
When this spell is cast, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all enemies within the area of effect, making their position and movements easily visible. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, invisibility, or similar effects, and suffer a -2 penalty to AC. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell are totally unaffected by the spell. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
