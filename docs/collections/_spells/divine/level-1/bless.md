Sphere: All  
Range: Long  
Duration: 5 turns

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage dice rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).
