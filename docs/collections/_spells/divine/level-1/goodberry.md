Casting a Goodberry spell creates 5 magical berries that the caster can carry with him or give to others. These berries initially cure 1 point of physical damage for each one eaten. For every three levels of experience, the berries heal one additional point of damage (to a maximum of 7 points at level 18). The berries last for 8 hours, or until eaten.
