Using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant ten small stones, no larger than sling bullets. The character using them can then hurl up to three stones per round at an opponent, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls. Each stone that hits inflicts 1d4+2 points of damage (1d4+5 against undead), and is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit. The magic in each stone expires after 2 turns or when used.
