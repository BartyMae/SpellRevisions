This spell is the reverse of Cure Light Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell inflicts 1d8 + 1/level points of damage upon the target (up to a maximum of 1d8+10). The spell expires once the priest makes a successful melee attack or after 1 turn has passed. The priest gains a +4 bonus to hit the target. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
