When this spell is cast, a misty bank of fog billows out from the designated point obscuring all sight. Everyone within the cloud suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls, and have their line of sight halved. Anyone, inside or outside the cloud, trying to attack a creature concealed by the fog with ranged weapons will do so with a -4 penalty to attack rolls. Creatures with blindsight, or that do not rely on sight can fight within the cloud without penalties.
