This spell turns natural weapons (such as teeth, claws, etc.) of friendly animals within range into magical weapons, effectively granting a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. For every other five experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +3 enchantment level, +3 to attack rolls, and +3 to damage for a 15th-level caster. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
