This spell surrounds the caster with an invisible curtain of stormy winds that moves with him. The wind wall grants the caster +4 bonus to saves vs. breath and AC against missiles for the duration of the spell. Non-magical missile weapons are deflected away, while gases cannot penetrate the barrier. Tiny and small flying creatures cannot pass through.
