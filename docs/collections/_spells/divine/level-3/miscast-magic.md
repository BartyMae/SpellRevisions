Miscast Magic  
Level: 3  
School: Enchantment  
Sphere: Chaos  
Range: Long  
Duration: 5 rounds  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Spell negates  
  
Miscast Magic causes spells cast by the affected creature to take on an effect different from what they intend, similar to what happens during a wild surge. There is a chance that the result will be beneficial to the spellcaster, but generally, the effects are undesirable. The target must make save vs. spell at -2 to negate the spell's effects. Those who fail the save will miscast any spells cast in the next round, and each round after the first must make another save to avoid miscasting for one further round. The effects of the spell last for 5 rounds, or until dispelled.
