Level: 3

A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any enemy violating the warded area will trigger the trap.  
  
When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d4). Those who a roll successful saving throw vs. breath will receive only half damage. This spell will not harm party members.
