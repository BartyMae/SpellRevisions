Call Lightning  
Level: 3  
School: Alteration  
Sphere: Weather  
Range: Long  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: 360' radius  
Saving Throw: Breath half  
  
Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, the caster causes a 30-foot-long vertical bolt of lightning to come crashing down upon an enemy. The spell has a duration of one round for every three levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 15th level. The lightning will strike first at the target of the spell, dealing 6d6 points of electrical damage, with a successful save vs. breath at -2 reducing this to half. For the remainder of the storm's duration, the bolts will strike out randomly at the enemies of the caster.
