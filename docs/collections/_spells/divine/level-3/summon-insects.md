Summon Insects  
Level: 3  
School: Conjuration  
Sphere: Animal  
Range: Long  
Duration: 6 rounds  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
The Summon Insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack one enemy of the caster. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks a single creature the caster points to.  
  
For the duration of the spell, the affected creature fights with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round the victim suffers 2d3 points of damage from insect bites, and has a 100% chance of spell failure. If a successful save vs. breath at -2 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
