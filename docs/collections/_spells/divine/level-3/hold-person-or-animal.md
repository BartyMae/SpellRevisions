This spell holds persons and animals rigidly immobile and in place. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every hostile person or animal within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on a save vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected.  
  
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.
