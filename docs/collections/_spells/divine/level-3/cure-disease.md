By laying her hands upon a sickly person, the caster can cure almost any disease with this spell. The cure is permanent, but this does not grant the recipient of the spell immunity from further afflictions. Blindness and deafness are also cured with this spell, but some powerful magically created diseases may not be curable by this spell.
