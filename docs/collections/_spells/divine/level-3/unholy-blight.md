With this spell the priest calls up unholy power to smite his enemies. The power takes the form of a chilling, cloying miasma of darkness. Opponents within the spell's area of effect take 1d4 points of damage for every level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d4), with a successful saving throw vs. spell for half. If the victim fails his save, then he will also receive a -2 penalty on his attack rolls and saving throws for 4 rounds.
