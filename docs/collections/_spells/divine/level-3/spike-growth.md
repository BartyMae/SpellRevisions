Spike Growth  
Level: 3  
School: Alteration  
Sphere: Plant  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 20' radius  
Saving Throw: Breath partial  
  
The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. Any creature will suffer 1d4 points of piercing damage each round that they remain within the affected area. The spikes can damage the victim's legs, so that even once they are free of the spike growth their movement rate is halved for 3 rounds unless a successful save vs. breath is made. Those failing the save also suffer 1 point of bleeding damage each round for 3 rounds. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are elementals and exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the small spikes.
