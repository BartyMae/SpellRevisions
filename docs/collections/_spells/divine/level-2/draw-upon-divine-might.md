When this spell is cast, the priest's body shudders and glows with a shimmering aura as it becomes a vessel for the power of his god. When he does this, his strength, dexterity, and constitution scores are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster, to a maximum of 3 points at level 9. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar spells.
