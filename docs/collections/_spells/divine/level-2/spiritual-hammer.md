By calling upon his deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. The caster wields the spiritual hammer as if proficient with the weapon, at his normal THAC0. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it can be used to strike at any opponents within 20 feet, but the wielder does not receive the standard penalty for holding a ranged weapon when engaged in close combat. At level 1, it functions as a magical weapon, dealing 1d8+1 points of magic damage, with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every five experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +5 enchantment level, +5 to attack rolls, and +5 to damage for a 20th-level caster. Due to its ethereal nature, strength modifiers do not apply to attack rolls or damage, and attacks with the spiritual weapon are considered melee touch attacks (+4 attack roll bonus).
