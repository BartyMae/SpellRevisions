With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand. The caster wields this blade-like ray as if proficient with the weapon, at his normal THAC0. At level 3, it functions as a magical weapon, dealing 2d6+1 points of fire damage, with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every other three experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +3 enchantment level, +3 to attack rolls, and +3 to damage for a 9th-level caster. Since the blade is immaterial, strength modifiers do not apply to attack rolls or damage, and attacks with the flame blade are considered melee touch attacks (+4 attack roll bonus).
