Silence  
Level: 2  
School: Alteration  
Sphere: Guardian  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 15' radius  
Saving Throw: Spell negates  
  
Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast unless an affected spellcaster then casts Vocalize. All enemies in the area must make a saving throw vs. spell at -4; if the save is failed, then they are silenced for the duration of the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15 foot radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).
