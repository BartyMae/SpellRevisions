Fire Trap  
Level: 2  
School: Abjuration  
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)  
Range: Short  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 20' radius  
Saving Throw: Breath half  
  
This powerful trap harms those who enter, pass, or open the selected area or object. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any enemy violating the selected area will trigger the trap.  
  
When the spell is cast, the druid weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the trap, it is triggered and explodes, damaging every enemy within a 20 foot radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d4 points of fire damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d4). Those who a roll successful saving throw vs. breath will receive only half damage. This spell will not harm party members.
