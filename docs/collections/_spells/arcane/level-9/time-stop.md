School: Alteration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 3 rounds  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
Upon casting a Time Stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop in the entire area that the caster is currently in. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for three rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. When the spell duration ceases, everyone is again operating in normal time. All spells cast during the Time Stop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.
