At the culmination of this dreadful spell, the wizard screams like a banshee (groaning spirit). Everyone in the area of effect hears the awful cry. Enemies who fail a saving throw vs. death at -2 die instantly, and those surviving the wail are deafened for 2 rounds. The caster and his companions are immune to the effects of the wail.
