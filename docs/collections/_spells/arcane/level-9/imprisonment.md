Imprisonment  
Level: 9  
School: Abjuration  
Range: Short  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When the Imprisonment spell is cast the target creature becomes entombed in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth in a state of suspended animation, conscious of its fate. The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists, rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned then he will reappear exactly where he was last standing. Dispel magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
