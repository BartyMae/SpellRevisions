Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a living creature and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining him of 4 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill. These effects last for 1 hour. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
