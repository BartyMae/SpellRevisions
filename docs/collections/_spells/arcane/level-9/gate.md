By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack his foes and himself if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Pit Fiend, the most powerful specimen of the Baatezu. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Mages are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Pit Fiend will turn on his summoner at the first available opportunity, tear him and his companions apart piece by piece and then feast on the remains.
