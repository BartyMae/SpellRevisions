Shapechange  
Level: 9  
School: Alteration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 5 turns  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: Caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of a powerful creature: that of an iron golem, a mind flayer, a greater wolfwere, or a spirit troll. The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and gains almost all of its natural abilities. The caster's mental attributes are not affected, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. All clothes and equipment he was wearing will mold into the new form and continue to function, unseen. When the wizard returns to his natural form, they will also return to their previous state. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.
