Wish is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. The wiser the wizard, the better chance that the right wording will be chosen. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.
