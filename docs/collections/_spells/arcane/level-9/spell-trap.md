Spell Trap  
Level: 9  
School: Abjuration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: Caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 99 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.
