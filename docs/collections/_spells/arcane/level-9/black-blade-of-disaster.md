Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about 5 feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).
