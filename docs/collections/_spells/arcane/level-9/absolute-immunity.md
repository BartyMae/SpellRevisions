When Absolute Immunity is cast, the caster gains complete invulnerability to physical and magical damage. This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration. Combined with a short casting time, these factors make the spell ideally suited for use in the thick of combat where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death.
