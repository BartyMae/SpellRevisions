Power Word Kill  
Level: 9  
School: Enchantment  
Range: Long  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When a Power Word Kill spell is uttered, one creature targeted by the caster is slain. Creatures who currently have 60 or more hit points can save vs. spell to avoid the effects, but those with 1 to 59 hit points are powerless to resist. Even if the creature's maximum hit points are higher than 60, its current hit points are used for this determination.
