This spell grants an almost omniscient perception of things to come. For the duration of the spell the mage's armor class is improved by 20 points, and any save is made by the caster with a +20 bonus. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of intense combat.
