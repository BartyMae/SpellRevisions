An Incendiary Cloud spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke and roaring flame. The smoke obscures all sight beyond 15 feet, including darkvision. Creatures within the area suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, the flames deal 4d6 points of fire damage each round to everything within the cloud, with a saving throw vs. breath at -4 allowed for half damage. Fire dwellers like fire elementals, fire giants, and salamanders are immune to the effects of this spell.
