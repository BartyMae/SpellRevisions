When this spell is cast, it confers complete protection from all energy attacks composed of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or magic damage, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the energy damage from attacks with weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of energy-based spells. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
