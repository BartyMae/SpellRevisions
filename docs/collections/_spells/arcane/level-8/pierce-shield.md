By means of this spell, the wizard may launch a massive attack on a target's physical and magical defenses. Pierce Shield will dispel one spell protection of any level from the target creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. After piercing through magical protections, this powerful spell will breach each and every combat protection on the target creature. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.  
  
The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Shield are: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, Mind Blank, and Spell Trap.  
  
The combat protection spells dispelled by Pierce Shield are: Mage Armor, Shield, Armor of Faith, Barkskin, Protection from Missiles, Spirit Armor, Stoneskin, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons, Physical Mirror, Prismatic Mantle, and Absolute Immunity.
