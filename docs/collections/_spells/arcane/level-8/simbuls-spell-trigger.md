This spell allows a mage to prepare a magical trigger that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action. The trigger can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 6th level or lower. A mage can only possess one spell trigger at a time, and the trigger will remain active until the spells contained within it are released.
