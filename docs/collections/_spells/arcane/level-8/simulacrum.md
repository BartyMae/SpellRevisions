When this spell is cast, the caster taps energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of himself. The duplicate is a near-perfect copy of the caster, making it a very powerful ally. The simulacrum is created at 60% of the level of the caster and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level. It also has 60% of the hit points of the caster. The simulacrum is fully under the control of the caster. The caster may have only one simulacrum at a time.
