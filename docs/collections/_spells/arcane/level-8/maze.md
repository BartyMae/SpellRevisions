An extradimensional space is brought into being upon utterance of a Maze spell. The subject vanishes into the shifting labyrinth of force planes for a period of time that is dependent upon its intelligence.

 3 to 5 -- 10d4 rounds

If the 9th level spell Freedom is cast in the area where a creature is mazed, it will effectively bring him back to this plane, ending the spell prematurely. Otherwise, the effect lasts for the duration of the spell. A mazed creature cannot be freed through a dispel magic.
