Hold Monster  
Level: 5  
School: Enchantment  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'  
Saving Throw: Spell negates  
  
This spell holds creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.  
  
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.
