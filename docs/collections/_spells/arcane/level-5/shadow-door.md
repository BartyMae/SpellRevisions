Shadow Door  
Level: 5  
School: Illusion  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality he has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible, for the spell duration. Opponents within 5 feet of the caster must save vs. spell or be fooled into following the caster through the door, becoming trapped in an extradimensional room for up to 4 rounds. Creatures with exceptional intelligence may escape the illusion faster, while creatures who can see through illusions (e.g. dragons, liches, demons), or are under the effects of a True Seeing spell, are unaffected.
