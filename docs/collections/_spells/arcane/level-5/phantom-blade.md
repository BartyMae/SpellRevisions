This spell creates a translucent, weightless, shadowlike sword made of material from the Plane of Shadow that extends 3 feet from the caster's hand. The caster wields the phantom blade as if it was a long sword but he suffers no penalty for non-proficiency. The sword deals 1d12+4 points of magic damage to its victims, and an additional 10 points of damage against undead creatures. Due to its ethereal nature, strength bonuses do not apply, but attacks with the phantom blade are considered melee touch attacks, and thus gain a +4 bonus to hit. Furthermore, a successful strike temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail (save vs. spell at a -4 penalty negates). The blade is considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what it can hit, but it cannot harm inorganic things because it has no solid existence. The phantom blade can only be used by the caster, and remains in his hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
