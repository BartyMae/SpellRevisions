Lower Resistance  
Level: 5  
School: Alteration  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When cast upon a target creature, this spell will lower their magic resistance by 2% per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level). There is no saving throw vs. this spell and magic resistance is ignored. This spell is not affected by dispel magic. Once it has been cast, there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.  
  
For example, if a creature has 50% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th level mage, then its magic resistance would be lowered by 30% automatically. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell. If this spell was cast upon this same creature again, the creature's magic resistance would be 50% - 30% (initial casting) - 30% (current casting) which would leave the creature with 0% magic resistance after both spells have been cast.
