Fireburst  
Level: 5  
School: Evocation  
Range: Personal  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 15' radius  
Saving Throw: Breath half  
  
This spell creates an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it, similar to a fireball. The wizard gestures with his hand and the entire area around him erupts in flames, striking all except the caster for 1d6 points of damage per level of the wizard (up to a maximum of 15d6). Creatures who fail their saving throw vs. breath at -4 suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage.
