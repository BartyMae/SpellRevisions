Cloudkill

School: Conjuration  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 30' radius  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly, yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4 Hit Dice, and cause creatures with 4 to 6 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poison with -4 penalties or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those with more than 6 Hit Dice must leave the cloud immediately, or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect. Undead creatures are not affected by the poisonous cloud.
