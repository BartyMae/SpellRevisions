Upon casting Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Earth, and an earth elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell duration expires, or upon the elemental's death. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes - there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.
