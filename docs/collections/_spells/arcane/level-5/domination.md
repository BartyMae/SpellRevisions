Domination

School: Enchantment  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Spell negates  
  
The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any one creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals. The target gets a saving throw vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.
