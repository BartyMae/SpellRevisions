When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped spray of extreme cold to spring forth from the wizard's hand. The cone is 30 feet in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of 60 degrees in front of the wizard. It drains heat and causes 1d4+1 points of damage per level of experience of the wizard (to a maximum of 15d4+15 at level 15), with a save vs. breath at -4 allowed for half damage.
