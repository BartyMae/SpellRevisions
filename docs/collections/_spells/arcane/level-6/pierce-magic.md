Range: Long  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.  
  
The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Magic are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, and Mind Blank.
