When a Protection from Magic Energy spell is cast, the recipient receives complete protection from all magic damage-based attacks. 100% of the damage from attacks like Cause Wound will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of spells such as Magic Missile, Skull Trap, Disintegrate, and Horrid Wilting. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled. Certain creatures are immune to the effects of this spell, including all undead.
