When this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from his original position. Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where he used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster. The illusory double vanishes after 6 rounds and cannot perform any actions at all, like attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage. As long as the image isn't destroyed, the caster can attack and cast spells while remaining completely hidden. The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys the illusion.
