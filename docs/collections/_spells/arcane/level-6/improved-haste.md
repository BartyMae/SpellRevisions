When this spell is cast, each affected creature functions at double normal movement rate, gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls, armor class, and saving throws vs. breath, and can make one extra attack each round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. There are three major differences between the third level wizard spell Haste and this spell. The first major difference is that this spell will affect all allied creatures within its area of effect. The second major difference is that there is no period of fatigue following the expiration of the spell. Third and finally, this haste spell cannot be counter by Slow.
