Disintegrate  
Level: 6  
School: Alteration  
Range: Long  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Breath partial  
  
Upon casting this spell at another creature, a thin green ray shoots unerringly from the caster's fingertip toward the target. Upon contact, the creature must make a saving throw vs. breath at -2 or suffer 2d6 points of magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.
