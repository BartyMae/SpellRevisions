This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This 8 hit dice monster obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 8 hours or until it is killed - at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.
