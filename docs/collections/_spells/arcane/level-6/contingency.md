Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of his repertoire of known spells. The spell level must be lower or equal to the level of the caster divided by three. Once the spell is chosen, the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of his maximum hit points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically. For example, a 12th level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of his maximum hit points'. Then once the wizard is reduced to 50% or less of his total hit points in combat, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon him. This requires no action by the wizard, happening automatically and instantaneously. The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, the spell stored cannot be an offensive spell nor can it target any other party members.
