Protection from Magical Weapons  
Level: 6  
School: Abjuration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 4 rounds  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: Caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by magical weapons; all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere, then immediately fall to the ground). This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted as well as attacks of especially powerful monsters. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat. The spell's effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
