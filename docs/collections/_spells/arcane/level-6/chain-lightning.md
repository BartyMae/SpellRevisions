Chain Lightning  
Level: 6  
School: Evocation  
Range: Long  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'  
Saving Throw: Breath half  
  
This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from the caster's fingertips. Unlike Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies within range, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every level of the caster to the primary target (up to a maximum of 20d6) and 1d6 for every two levels to subsequent targets (up to a maximum of 10d6). Those who roll successful saving throws vs. breath at -4 manage to partially avoid direct impact from the lightning and hence receive only half damage.
