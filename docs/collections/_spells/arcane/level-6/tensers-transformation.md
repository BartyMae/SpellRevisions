Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. For when the mage casts the spell, he undergoes a startling transformation which alters his body and his mind into that of a warrior. The wizard gains 2 hit points per caster level (up to a maximum of 40), and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained. The armor class of the caster is 4 better than he possessed prior casting the spell, and all attack rolls are made with the THAC0 of a fighter of the same level as the caster. The mage gains extra attacks as a fighter of the same level, thus an extra half attack per round at 7th level and another half attack per round at 13th level. Furthermore, each attack is made at +2, each successful hit in combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage, and saving throws against death/poison are made by the caster with a +4 bonus, but casting speed is penalized by 2 and saving throws against spell are made by the caster with a -2 penalty.  
  
Note: this spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/mages, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter levels.
