Conjure Air Elemental  
Level: 6  
School: Conjuration  
Range: Medium  
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 1 round  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
Upon casting a Conjure Air Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Air, and an air elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. Normally, an elemental with 12 hit dice will be conjured. At fifteenth level and above, however, the caster will be able to summon an elemental with 16 hit dice. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All of the commands given to the elemental are done so telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes - there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.
