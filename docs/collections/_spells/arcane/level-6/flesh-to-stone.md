Flesh to Stone is a powerful magic that permanently turns the flesh of the creature affected into stone. When struck by this spell the target is slowed for 3 rounds as its flesh begins to harden. The following round the subject of the spell must save vs. petrification at -4 or be turned into a statue. A dispel magic spell cannot restore the victim's natural form, but some powerful spells, such as Stone to Flesh or Freedom, can. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or incorporeal creatures.
