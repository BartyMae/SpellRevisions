Duration: 5 rounds

When a wizard casts a Detect Invisibility spell, he becomes able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible within a 50 foot radius, as well as any that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. Instantly and once each round for 5 rounds after the spell is cast, all concealed enemies within the area of effect will become visible to the caster and his allies. Invisible objects carried into the warded area will also become visible. This spell does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
