When Stinking Cloud is cast, a billowing mass of nauseous vapors appears centered on a point selected by the caster. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be nauseated for 1 round. Nauseated characters are unable to attack or cast spells, but can still move. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A dispel magic will temporarily remove the nausea from a particular character, but they will continue to be subjected to the spell's effects so long as they remain within the cloud. Certain creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud, including all undead, and creatures who don't need to breathe, such as elementals.
