Agannazar's Scorcher  
Level: 2  
School: Evocation  
Range: Medium  
Duration: 2 rounds  
Casting Time: 2  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be hit by this flame for 3d6 points of damage. The fiery ray will persist for one further round, burning the victim for another 3d6 points of fire damage. Other creatures who cross the path of the flame jet will also take damage as long as they stand in the flame. There is no saving throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as fire resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage.
