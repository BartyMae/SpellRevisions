Glitterdust  
Level: 2  
School: Conjuration  
Range: Medium  
Duration: 4 rounds  
Casting Time: 2  
Area of Effect: 10' radius  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
This spell creates a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 4 rounds. Those failing the save remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.
