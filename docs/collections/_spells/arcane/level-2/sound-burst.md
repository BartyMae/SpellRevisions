Sound Burst  
Level: 2  
School: Evocation  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 2  
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 10'  
Saving Throw: Breath partial  
  
This spell blasts an area with a tremendous cacophony. Enemies within the area suffer 4d4 points of crushing damage, and are deafened for 1 turn. A successful save vs. breath at -2 penalty halves the damage and negates the deafness. Deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spell. This deafness can be done away with by means of a Dispel Magic spell or a Cure Disease spell.
