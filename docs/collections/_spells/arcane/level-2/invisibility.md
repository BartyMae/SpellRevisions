Invisibility  
Level: 2  
School: Illusion  
Range: Touch  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 2  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around him such as opening doors, disarming traps, or opening chests. An invisible creature can drink a potion, or cast non-attack spells centered on himself and remain invisible, but he cannot attack nor cast spells on other targets without ending the spell. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 8 hours have passed.
