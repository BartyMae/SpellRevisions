When a wizard utters this power word, he causes a comatose slumber to come upon one creature. Creatures who currently have 20 or more hit points can save vs. spell to avoid the effects, but those with 1 to 19 hit points are powerless to resist. Elves and half-elves are particularly resistant to sleep effects, while the undead and certain other creatures such as dragons and elementals are completely immune to magically induced sleep.
