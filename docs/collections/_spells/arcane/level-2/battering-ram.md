This spell creates a ram-like force that can strike with considerable power. The force can be used to open or smash locked, held, or wizard-locked doors, as well as locked boxes or chests, but it does not raise barred gates or similar impediments. If used against a creature, the target suffers 2d6 points of crushing damage, and must save vs. breath to avoid being knocked unconscious for 1 round.
