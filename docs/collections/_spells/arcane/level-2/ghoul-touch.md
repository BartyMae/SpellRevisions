When the caster completes this spell, a red glow encompasses his hand. On a successful touch from the wizard, the spell inflicts 1d8 points of magic damage and paralyzes the target for 5 rounds unless a successful save vs. death at a -1 penalty is made. The wizard gains a +4 bonus to hit the target and his touch is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit.
