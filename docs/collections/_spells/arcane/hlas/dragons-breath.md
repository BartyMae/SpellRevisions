This spell causes the disembodied head of a red dragon to appear and breathe fire with the strength of an adult red dragon. In addition to the enormous 24d6 fireball, the force of the dragon's breath knocks opponents away from the caster and leaves them unconscious for 1 round. The victims can save vs. breath at a -2 penalty to take half damage and not be blown backwards. This spell will not harm party members. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.
