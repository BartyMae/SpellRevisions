An energy blade is a discus made of pure energy. The discs are thrown with a +10 bonus to THAC0, inflict 1d4+5 missile damage as well as 1d10 additional electrical damage, and are considered to be of +5 enchantment to determine what they can hit. This spell creates 20 energy discs and sets the caster's number of attacks per round to 9 as long as the discs are held.
