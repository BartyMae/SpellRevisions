When this spell is cast, the wizard can disturb the emotional state of those around him. The effect of this is to inflict a feeling of absolute hopelessness upon enemies within visual range of the caster. Upon a failed saving throw vs. spell at -2, those affected will receive a -4 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage, and a +4 penalty to armor class. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
