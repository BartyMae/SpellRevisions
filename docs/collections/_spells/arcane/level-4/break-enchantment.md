Upon casting this spell, the mage is able to free a victim from enchantments and curses. The spell can reverse the effects of charm, confusion and feeblemindedness, free a victim from magical sleep or charm, and break the effects of a curse. Note that Break Enchantment cannot remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, but allows those afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or through a particular ritual.
