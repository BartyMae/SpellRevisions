Spirit Armor  
Level: 4  
School: Necromancy  
Range: Touch  
Duration: 10 turns  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell taps the target's life force in order to create a corporeal barrier around his body. The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spellcasting in any way. The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor, but it will stack with bonuses from dexterity, shields, and magical trinkets. While in effect, the armor class of the recipient will be set to 1, and saving throws vs. death will be made with a +3 bonus. There is a danger in using this spell, however, as the external portion of the target's spirit is temporarily lost when the spell duration expires. This causes the recipient to suffer 2d4 points of damage, unless he succeeds at a saving throw vs. spell.
