When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon himself, an outer skin of stone will emerge from the ground, completely covering and shielding him. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two levels of the caster. For example, a 10th level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him, but the sixth would affect him normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until he is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.  
  
It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any area attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of inflicting some type of elemental damage can still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.
