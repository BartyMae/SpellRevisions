Minor Globe of Invulnerability

School: Abjuration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: Caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic.
