When a Secret Word spell is uttered, it will dispel one spell protection of 7th level or lower on the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.  
  
The spell protection spells dispelled by Secret Word are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, and Shield of the Archons.
