This spell allows a mage to prepare a magical matrix that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action. The matrix can store two spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 2nd level or lower. A mage can only possess one spell matrix at a time, and the matrix will remain active until the spells contained within it are released.
