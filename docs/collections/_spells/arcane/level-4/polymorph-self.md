Polymorph Self  
Level: 4  
School: Alteration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 5 turns  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: Caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature: that of a flind, an ogre, a mustard jelly, a sword spider, or a winter wolf. The caster also gains the form's physical mode of locomotion and breathing. This spell does not give the caster access to the new form's other abilities such as special attacks or magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.  
  
For the duration of the spell, the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, as many times as he wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The wizard's mental attributes are not affected, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the wizard.
