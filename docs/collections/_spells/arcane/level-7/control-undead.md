Control Undead  
Level: 7

The Control Undead spell allows the caster to take control of undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 5 or more Hit Dice/levels less than the caster then there is no saving throw allowed, else a save vs. spell at -6 is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a dispel magic.
