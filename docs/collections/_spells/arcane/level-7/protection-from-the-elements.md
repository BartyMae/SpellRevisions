When this spell is cast, it confers complete protection from all elemental attacks composed of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the elemental damage from attacks with weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of elemental spells. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
