When this spell is cast on the target creature, it will dispel one spell protection of up to 8th level or lower. Every round thereafter, until the duration of the spell expires, another spell protection will be removed from the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.  
  
The spell protection spells dispelled by Khelben's Warding Whip are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, and Mind Blank.
