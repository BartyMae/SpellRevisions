By casting the Summon Nishruu spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, the Nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination the churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the Nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Nishruus do not use physical attacks, and they disregard physical attacks made on them, though these attacks can hurt them. Each time a Nishruu touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from him. Excluding Banishment or a dispel magic, the Nishruu is completely immune to magic, and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, dispelled, or the spell duration expires.
