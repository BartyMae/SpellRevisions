This spell allows a mage to prepare a magical sequencer that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action. The sequencer can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 4th level or lower. A mage can only possess one spell sequencer at a time, and the sequencer will remain active until the spells contained within it are released.
