Improved Chaos Shield increases a wild mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a wild surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the wild surge chart, an extra 25 is added to the dice roll. When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Improved Chaos Shield stacks with the wild mage's level bonus. The caster may have only one chaos shield at a time.
