When this spell is cast, an opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light temporarily surrounds the caster. Opponents that hit the caster with a weapon or spell from within this radius are subject to a random prismatic effect. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.
