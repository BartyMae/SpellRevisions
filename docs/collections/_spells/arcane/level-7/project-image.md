When this spell is cast, an illusory copy of the casting wizard appears to step out of his body while at the same time the mage is concealed with invisibility. The image can move around, and has the same hit points and can cast the same spells as the wizard, but it cannot make any physical attacks. The caster must maintain concentration on the illusory clone for the duration of the spell and cannot perform any other action while controlling it. If the image is destroyed then the spell ends and the caster can move again. If during this time the caster takes any damage, the image will disappear and the caster will be free to move around once more. Otherwise, the image will remain for the duration of the spell or until affected by a dispel magic or destroyed.
