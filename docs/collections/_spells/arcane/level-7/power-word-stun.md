When a Power Word Stun spell is uttered, any creature of the mage's choice within visual range is stunned for a length of time dependent upon its current hit points. Creatures with 1 to 29 hit points are stunned for 4d4 rounds, while those with 30 to 59 are stunned for 2d4 rounds, those with 60 to 89 are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and those with 90 or more are stunned for 1 round. Note that if a creature is weakened so that its hit points are below its usual maximum, its current number of hit points is used to determine the spell's effect.
