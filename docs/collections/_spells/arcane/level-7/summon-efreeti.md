With this spell, the conjurer can cajole an efreeti, a massive genie with powerful abilities, to leave the Elemental Plane of Fire and enter the Prime Material Plane. The gated genie is immune to Banishment and has access to several spell-like abilities which can be cast instantly as a 10th level caster. Once per day an efreeti can turn into gaseous form, becoming immune to almost all forms of damage for a short time. The genie will generally use this ability when badly injured, to either regenerate before attacking again, or to leave the battlefield avoiding further damage. The efreeti will serve for the duration indicated above, attacking the enemies of the conjurer until the duration of the spell runs out.
