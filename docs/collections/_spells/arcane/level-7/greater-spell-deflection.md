Greater Spell Deflection  
Level: 7  
School: Abjuration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 5 turns  
Casting Time: 7  
Area of Effect: Caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 12 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.  
  
This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).
