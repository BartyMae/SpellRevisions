Skull Trap  
Level: 3  
School: Necromancy  
Range: Medium  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 20' radius  
Saving Throw: Breath half  
  
Upon casting this spell, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 15 feet of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes, damaging everyone within a 20 foot radius. The explosion deals 1d6 points of magic damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6), with a save vs. breath at -2 allowed for half damage. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party, lest they set it off accidentally. Undead creatures are not affected by this spell.
