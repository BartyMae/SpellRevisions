This spell enables the wizard to summon small globes of fire (one for each level of experience of the caster), which, when thrown, burst upon impact and inflict 1d4 points of piercing damage plus 2d4 points of fire damage to the creature struck. The wizard gains a +5 bonus to hit with the missiles, and each meteor is considered to be of +2 enchantment to determine what it can hit. The wizard may discharge up to five missiles per round.
