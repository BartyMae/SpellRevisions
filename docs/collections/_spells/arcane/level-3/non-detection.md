By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature touched undetectable by divination spells such as Detect Invisibility, Oracle, and True Seeing, or by a thief's Detect Illusion ability, though an invisible person may still be audible when moving and his presence may still be sensed. Non-Detection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.
