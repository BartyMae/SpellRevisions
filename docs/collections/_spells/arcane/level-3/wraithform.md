When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better enchantment, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. The wizard also gains 25% resistance to magic damage. While in wraithform, the caster cannot cast either arcane or divine spells.
