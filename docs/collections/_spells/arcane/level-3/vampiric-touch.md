Vampiric Touch  
Level: 3  
School: Necromancy  
Range: Touch  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When this spell is cast, the target loses 3 hit points for every two caster levels, to a maximum drain of 30 for a 20th level caster. These hit points are added to the caster's current hit points, with any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points. The temporary hit points last for 5 turns.  
  
Note that this spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's hit points. The caster must wait for the first Vampiric Touch spell to run its course before casting another.
