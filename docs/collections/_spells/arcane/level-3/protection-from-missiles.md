By means of this spell, the wizard bestows upon a creature total invulnerability to hurled and projected missiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, and sling stones. This spell does not convey any protection from magical attacks such as Fireballs, Lightning Bolts, or Magic Missiles, but magically created missiles such as Melf's Acid Arrows, Melf's Minute Meteors, and Flame Arrows will be harmlessly deflected.
