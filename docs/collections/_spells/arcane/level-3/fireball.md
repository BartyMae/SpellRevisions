Fireball  
Level: 3  
School: Evocation  
Range: Long  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 30' radius  
Saving Throw: Breath half  
  
A fireball is an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar, delivering damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures who fail their saving throw vs. breath at -2 suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage.
