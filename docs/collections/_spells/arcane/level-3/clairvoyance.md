This spell grants an unnatural perception of things to come. Once Clairvoyance is cast, the caster receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm. He becomes impossible to surprise and cannot be backstabbed. In addition, the spell gives a general idea of what action might be taken to best protect oneself, granting a +2 insight bonus to AC and saves vs. breath. The effects last for the duration of the spell, and cannot be dispelled.
