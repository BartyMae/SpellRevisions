School: Illusion  
Range: Personal

This spell confers invisibility upon all friendly creatures within 10 feet of the caster. Creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not. If an affected creature makes an attack, they will negate the invisibility only for themselves. The spell otherwise lasts for 1 turn.
