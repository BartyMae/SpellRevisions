Halt Undead  
Level: 3  
School: Necromancy  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'  
Saving Throw: Spell negates  
  
This spell stops undead creatures in their place for the duration of the spell. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any undead creatures within 5 feet of the target are also affected. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected by the spell.  
  
Those affected become unable move or groan, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence the effect does not stop any worsening of their condition due to injury or rot.
