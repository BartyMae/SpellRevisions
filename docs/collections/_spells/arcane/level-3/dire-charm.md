Dire Charm  
Level: 3  
School: Enchantment  
Range: Long  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Spell negates  
  
This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with two differences: the saving throw has no bonus, and the enchantment has a longer duration. Dire Charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. If the recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.  
  
If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.
