When this spell is cast, the wizard creates an insubstantial but quasi-real suit of armor. This semi-illusory material covers the subject and actually gives some real protection provided that opponents don't actively disbelieve in the armor (detecting the illusion) and neither a dispel magic nor detect illusion spell is cast upon it. Until dispelled or disbelieved, the armor sets the recipient's base armor class to 2. This spell will not function with any other form of magical armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity bonuses and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The ghost armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. A favourite among mage/thieves, the ghostly nimbus of light which surrounds the recipient grants +20% bonus to Hide in Shadows.
