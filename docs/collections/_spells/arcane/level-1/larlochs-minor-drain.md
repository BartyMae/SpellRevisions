With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to his own. The target creature suffers 2 points of damage, while the mage gains 2 hit points. For every two extra levels of the caster, the draining is augmented by 2 points (up to a maximum of 10 points at 9th level). If the mage goes over his maximum hit point total with this spell, he loses it after 1 turn.
