When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard, granting him immunity to the spell Magic Missile. Furthermore, the fluctuating force shield around the caster acts similarly to a regular shield, effectively increasing AC by 2 points (+4 vs. missile weapons). This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
