This spell transports the caster to any place within sight. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, which he immediately steps through. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds himself at his chosen destination. The caster always arrives at exactly the spot desired, and the dimensional door doesn't allow anyone or anything else to pass through. Spells about to be cast upon the wizard will fail, and missiles about to hit him will instead hit thin air.
