When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses his hand. This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature suffers 1d6 points of cold damage and loses one point of strength for 1 hour (no ability drain if the victim saves vs. death). The wizard gains a +4 bonus to hit the target and his touch is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit.
