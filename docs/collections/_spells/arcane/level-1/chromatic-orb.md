Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 1

This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly towards its target. The sphere inflicts magic damage and causes different effects depending upon its color. As the level of the caster improves, both the damage inflicted and number of colors known increases. The color of any given orb is chosen randomly from the colors known at the wizard's level. The orb is occasionally even multicolored, causing multiple effects. The victim can save vs. spell against all special effects but gets no save against the damage. All special effects last for 5 rounds.
