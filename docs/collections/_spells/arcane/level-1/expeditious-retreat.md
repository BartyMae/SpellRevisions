Expeditious Retreat  
Level: 1  
School: Alteration  
Range: Personal  
Duration: 3 rounds  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When cast, this spell provides all friendly creatures in the area with an amazing fleetness of foot. The affected creatures movement rate is almost tripled for the duration of the spell, but the excessively unnatural speed prevents them from taking almost any other actions except for running.
