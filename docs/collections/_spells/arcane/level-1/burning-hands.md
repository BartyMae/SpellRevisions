When the wizard casts this spell, a cone of searing flames shoots from his fingertips towards a designated point. His hands must be held so as to send forth a fan-like sheet of flames: the wizard's thumbs must touch each other and his fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out 10-foot-long jets of flame in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the wizard. All creatures caught in the flames suffer 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 for every other 2 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of 5d6).
