Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from his hand. The spray is 15 feet in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the wizard. The spell's effects depend upon the caster's level - creatures with Hit Dice/levels less than or equal to the caster are slowed for 5 rounds, those with Hit Dice/levels one or two greater than the wizard are blinded for 3 rounds, and all others are confused for 1 round. Creatures with more than 22 Hit Dice/levels will have to save only against the confusion effect, regardless of the caster's level.
