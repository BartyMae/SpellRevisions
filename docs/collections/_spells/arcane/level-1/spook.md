Spook  
Level: 1  
School: Illusion  
Range: Long  
Duration: 5 rounds  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 (to save against this spell) for every two extra experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -4 at 9th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead creatures, certain powerful creatures who can easily discern the illusion, such as dragons, and those with no intelligence score are unaffected by this spell, as are creatures under the effect of a True Seeing spell.
