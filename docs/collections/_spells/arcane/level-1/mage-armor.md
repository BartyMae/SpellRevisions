By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that sets its base armor class to 6. This improves by 1 AC for every four levels of the caster, up to a minimum base armor class of 3 at 12th level. This armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.
