Shocking Grasp  
Level: 1  
School: Evocation  
Range: Personal  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When the wizard touches a creature while this spell is in effect, an electrical charge will deal 1d6 points of damage and stun the target for 1 round. If the target makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, he is not stunned. For every two extra experience levels of the caster, the creature will suffer an additional 1d6 points of damage and roll their saving throw at an increased -1 penalty (to a maximum of 5d6 damage and a -4 saving throw penalty at 9th level). The spell expires once the caster makes a successful melee attack or after 1 turn has passed. The wizard gains a +4 bonus to hit the target.
