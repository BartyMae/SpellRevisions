When a wizard casts a Sleep spell, he causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures. Creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw vs. spell or fall asleep. Any further attempts to harm the targets will waken them. Opponents with more Hit Dice/levels than the caster are unaffected by this spell. Elves and half-elves are particularly resistant to sleep effects, while the undead and certain other creatures such as dragons and elementals are completely immune to magically induced sleep.
