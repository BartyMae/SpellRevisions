When this spell is cast, the recipient receives a resistance to all magic. The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level. This resistance is set so that if the target already has more Magic Resistance than the priest would confer, it will actually lower it to the set value. This effect will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
