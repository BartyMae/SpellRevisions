Pixie Dust  
(Illusion/Phantasm)  
  
Level: 5  
Sphere: Combat  
Range: 0  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell creates a small handful of pixie dust that the caster can use to toss into the air. Any ally hit by the dust becomes invisible (the range of the dust is about 15 ft.). Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.  
  
The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the caster or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can walk around and cast defensive spells; however, if &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; attacks, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; to attack first.
