When the priest calls down a Flame Strike spell, a vertical column of fire roars downward in the exact location called for by the caster. The target must roll a Saving Throw vs. Spell. Failure means the creature sustains 1d8 points of damage per level of the caster; otherwise, the damage is halved.
