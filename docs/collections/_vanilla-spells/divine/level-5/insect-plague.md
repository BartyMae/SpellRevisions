Insect Plague   
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Sphere: Combat  
Level: 5  
Range: 360 ft.  
Duration: 6 rounds  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm. This swarm will jump first to the enemy target, then to the nearest allies of the target's, until up to 6 creatures have been affected. Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible (100% chance of spell failure). Creatures in the insect plague sustain 1 point of damage every 2 seconds they remain within regardless of their Armor Class, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. Due to the suffocating nature of the writhing insect swarm, each victim must make a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon or run away in fear for 1 round.
