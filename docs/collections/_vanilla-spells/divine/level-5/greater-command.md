As with the 1st-level spell Command, this spell enables the priest to command other creatures to "die" (sleep), except that the effects of this spell last 1 round per level of the caster. At the end of the round, the creature(s) awaken and are unharmed. The area of effect is similar to that of a Stinking Cloud or a Fireball.
