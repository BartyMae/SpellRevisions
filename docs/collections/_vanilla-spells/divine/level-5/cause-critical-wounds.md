This spell is the reverse of Cure Critical Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell inflicts 27 points of damage upon the target. The next attack that the priest makes will cause this effect; however, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; only has 2 rounds to make the attack before the spell fizzles. If the priest misses the target creature, the spell is wasted. There is no Saving Throw.
