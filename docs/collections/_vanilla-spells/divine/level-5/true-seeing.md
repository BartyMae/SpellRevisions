True Seeing  
(Divination)  
  
Level: 5  
Sphere: Divination  
Range: 0  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 8  
Area of Effect: 120-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: None   
  
When this spell is cast, an area roughly 120 ft. in radius around the caster will be affected. Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The area of effect is roughly a 120-ft. radius around the caster. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies; thus, it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.
