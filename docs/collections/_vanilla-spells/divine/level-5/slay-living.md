Slay Living  
(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 5  
Sphere: Combat  
Range: Touch   
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 1   
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
Upon casting this spell, the priest has to touch an opponent in order to visit the effect upon them. An item is created upon casting. The next attack the priest makes, which must happen in the next 3 rounds, will use this item. If the first attack misses, the item disappears and the spell is wasted; however, if the attack succeeds, the victim automatically takes 2d6+9 damage. Also, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; must make a Save vs. Spell or be instantly killed. Slay Living can be dispelled if cast between the casting of this spell and the necessary attack.
