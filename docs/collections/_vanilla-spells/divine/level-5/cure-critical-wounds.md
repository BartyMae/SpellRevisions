The Cure Critical Wounds spell is a very potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell. The priest lays &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hands upon a creature and heals 27 points of damage from wounds or other injuries. The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those not living.
