Mass Cure  
(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 5  
Sphere: Healing  
Range: 0  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When casting this spell, the priest must picture the faces of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; fellow party members clearly and focus on the unity of the group. Upon completion, all party members within a 15-ft. radius of the caster are healed 1d8 + 1/level Hit Points. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.
