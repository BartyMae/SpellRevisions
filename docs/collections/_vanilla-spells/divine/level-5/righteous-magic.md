This is a powerful combat spell that enhances the priest's physical prowess, transforming &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; into a juggernaut of destruction. The effect adds 1 temporary Hit Point per level of the caster, adds 1 point of Strength every 3 levels of the caster (to a maximum of 25), and causes every successful hit to inflict maximum damage. The effects last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
