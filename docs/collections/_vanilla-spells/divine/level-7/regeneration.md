This powerful spell enables the priest to imbue one creature with the ability to regenerate. This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs. The creature affected will regain 3 Hit Points per second. The effect lasts for 1 round per 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled. For example, a 14th-level priest would regenerate 18 Hit Points per round for 7 rounds.
