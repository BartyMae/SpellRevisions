Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area of effect to make a Saving Throw vs. Death or die. Creatures with more than 60 current Hit Points are immune to this effect.
