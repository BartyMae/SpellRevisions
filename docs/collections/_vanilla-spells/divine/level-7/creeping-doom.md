Creeping Doom   
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 7  
Sphere: Animal, Summoning   
Range: 240 ft.  
Duration: 3 rounds  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; calls forth a mass of venomous, biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpetlike mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all enemy creatures within 30 ft. of the target. Those trapped by the insects suffer 2 points of damage each second and a spell failure rate of 100%. For each round the victim remains inside the cloud, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; must make a Save vs. Spell at -2 or run away in fear for one round. The advantage of Creeping Doom over its 5th-level counterpart Insect Plague is that it does twice as much damage in half the amount of time.
