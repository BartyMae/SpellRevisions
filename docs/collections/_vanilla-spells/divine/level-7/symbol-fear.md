Symbol, Fear is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode causing all those within the area to make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -4 penalty or be affected by fear for 2 rounds + 1 round every 3 levels of the caster.
