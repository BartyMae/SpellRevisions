Greater Restoration  
(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 7  
Sphere: Necromantic  
Range: Touch  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None   
  
When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster. A Greater Restoration spell will also restore the Intelligence score of a creature affected by the Feeblemind spell and negate any form of insanity, such as confusion or berserk. It fully heals the target and cures any diseases or poisons. The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will likely require rest immediately afterward.
