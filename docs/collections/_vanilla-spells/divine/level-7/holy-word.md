Uttering a Holy Word spell creates magic of tremendous power. The priest acts as a bridge between &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; god and the Prime Material Plane, causing a small explosion centered on the priest and reaching up to a 15-ft. radius. It affects only enemy evil creatures and undead of any alignment that are caught in the area of effect. The effects vary depending on the target's Hit Dice:  
  
Hit Dice / Levels  —  Effects of Holy Word  
Less than 4  —  Death  
4 to 7  —  Stunned for 1 turn  
8 to 11  —  Slowed for 1 turn with a 75% chance of spell failure  
12 and up  —  Deafened for 1 turn with a 50% chance of spell failure  
  
There is no Saving Throw. The effects are instantaneous and last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled. Note that this spell may not be cast by any priest of evil alignment.
