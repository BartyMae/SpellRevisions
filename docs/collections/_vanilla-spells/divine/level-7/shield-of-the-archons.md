This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of spell levels equal to half the level of the caster. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest, as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the priest, it will be absorbed provided that there are spell levels remaining. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.
