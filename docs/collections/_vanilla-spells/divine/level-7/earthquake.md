Earthquake  
(Alteration)  
  
Level: 7  
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)  
Range: 360 ft.  
Duration: 3 tremors  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
When this spell is cast, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect. There are 3 tremors that are caused by the earthquake:   
  
 1st: All creatures affected take 6d6 points of damage and fall to the ground for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -6 penalty halves the damage and negates the fall.  
 2nd: All creatures affected take 3d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty halves the damage.  
 3rd: All creatures affected take 2d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell halves the damage.  
  
This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster's, so care must be taken in its use. Finally, earth elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear and attack the party.
