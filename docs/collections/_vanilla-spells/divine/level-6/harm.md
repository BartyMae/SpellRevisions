Harm  
(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 6  
Sphere: Healing  
Range: Touch  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell is the reverse of Heal. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell reduces the target to 1 Hit Point. The next attack that the priest makes will inflict this effect; however, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; only has 2 rounds to make the attack before the spell fizzles. If the priest misses the target creature, the spell is wasted. There is no Saving Throw.
