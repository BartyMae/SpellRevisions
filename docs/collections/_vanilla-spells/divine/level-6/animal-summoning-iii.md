By means of this spell, the caster calls 2 or 3 animals that have 12 Hit Dice or less. Only animals within visual range of the caster at the time the spell is cast will come. The summoned animals aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until they are slain or the spell's duration expires. Only normal- or giant-sized animals can be summoned.
