This spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the form of an invisible disk that protects the caster. Any missile weapon that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180-degree arc. The sender of the missile finds &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self the target of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; own attack. The caster of the mirror may direct missile attacks normally through the space occupied by the mirror.
