By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt;self and &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; party and causes harm to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; enemies. When the Chant spell is completed, all the priest's allies within the area of effect gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, minimum damage/healing rolls, and Saving Throws. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and an arrow of fire that deals 1d6 piercing plus 1d2 fire damage will deal 1d6 piercing plus 1 fire damage instead. The priest's enemies suffer the opposite effects.  
  
Multiple chants are not cumulative.
