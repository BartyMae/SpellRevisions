Aid  
(Necromancy, Conjuration)  
  
Level: 2  
Sphere: Necromantic   
Range: Touch   
Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level   
Casting Time: 5   
Area of Effect: 1 creature   
Saving Throw: None   
  
The recipient of this spell gains the benefits of a Bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and Saving Throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional Hit Points for the duration of the spell. The Aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more Hit Points than &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; current maximum. The bonus Hit Points are lost first when the recipient takes damage and may not be regained by curative magic.  
  
Example: A 1st-level Fighter has 8 Hit Points, suffers 2 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6), then receives an Aid spell that grants &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; 5 additional Hit Points. The Fighter now has 11 Hit Points, 3 of which are temporary. If &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is then hit for 7 points of damage, 4 normal Hit Points and all 3 temporary Hit Points are lost. The Fighter then receives a Cure Light Wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; original 8 Hit Points.
