By calling upon &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer, which &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; can use for the duration of the spell. It strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every 6 experience levels (or fraction) of the caster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 vs. opponents of man-size or smaller and 1d4 upon larger opponents, plus the magical bonus).
