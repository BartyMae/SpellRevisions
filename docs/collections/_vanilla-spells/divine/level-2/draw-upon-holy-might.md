The priest calls upon &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; god to grant &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; power for a short period. When &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; does this, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity are all raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster. A 3rd-level caster would have &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; abilities raised by 1, while a 12th-level caster would have &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; abilities raised by 4.
