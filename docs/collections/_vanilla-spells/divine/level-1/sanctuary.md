When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; opponents to ignore &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; existence as if &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; were invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to Bless &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self. The priest cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.
