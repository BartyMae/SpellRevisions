The caster of the Armor of Faith receives significant protection against melee and magical attacks. This magical armor is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster. At 1st level, the protection is 5%, and every 5 levels of the caster improves this by another 5%: For example, a 20th-level priest would have 25% of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; damage "absorbed" if protected by this spell.
