Cure Light Wounds  
(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 1  
Sphere: Healing  
Range: Touch  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
By casting this spell and laying &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hand upon a creature, the priest causes 8 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.  
  
Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.
