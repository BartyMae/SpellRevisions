By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast. Once per round, a creature can attempt to save vs. Spell with a +3 bonus to avoid entanglement. An entangled creature can still attack, but receives a -2 penalty to its Armor Class.
