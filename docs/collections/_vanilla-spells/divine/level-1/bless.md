Bless  
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 1  
Sphere: All  
Range: 40 ft.  
Duration: 6 rounds  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: None  
  
Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).
