This spell calls upon energy from the Negative Energy Plane in order to open a channel between it and the targets. The result is that any good creatures within the spell's area of effect take 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster, or half damage upon a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell. If the victims fail their Saving Throw, they also receive a -2 penalty to all their rolls for 4 rounds.
