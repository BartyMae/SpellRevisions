Cure Medium Wounds  
(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 3  
Sphere: Healing   
Range: Touch   
Duration: Permanent   
Casting Time: 5   
Area of Effect: 1 creature   
Saving Throw: None   
  
By casting this spell and laying &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hand upon a creature, the priest heals 14 points of wound or other injury damage from the creature's body. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.
