Summon Insects   
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 3  
Sphere: Animal  
Range: 90 ft.  
Duration: 7 rounds  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
The Summon Insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack one enemy of the caster. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range and attacks any single creature the caster points to. The victim may make a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon with a -4 penalty to escape the swarm; otherwise, the victim receives 1 point of damage every 2 seconds for the duration of the spell. Moreover, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; attack roll and a -2 penalty to &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% chance of spell failure).
