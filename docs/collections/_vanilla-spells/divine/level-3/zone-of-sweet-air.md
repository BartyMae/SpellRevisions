Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors (including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill). This spell will dismiss all clouds in the entire area that the caster is currently in. The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a dragon's breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon).
