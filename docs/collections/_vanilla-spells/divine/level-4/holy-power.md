Through this spell, the caster imbues &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self with the strength and skill of a Fighter of the same level. The priest's Strength score is set to 18/00—even if it is normally higher—&lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; THAC0 becomes that of a Fighter of the same level, and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; gains 1 temporary Hit Point per level. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
