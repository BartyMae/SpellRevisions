Spirit Fire  
(Conjuration)  
  
Level: 4  
Sphere: Summoning  
Range: 40 ft.   
Duration: Instant   
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius   
Saving Throw: Special  
  
As the Shaman casts this spell, energies gather together from the spirit world and form a pale blue sphere. The Shaman can throw the sphere so that it explodes into a burst of ghostly, azure flames, which deliver 1d4 points of magic damage per level of the Shaman (up to a maximum of 10d4). There is also a 33% chance that every enemy within the area of effect will be afflicted by the Doom spell (-2 penalty to Saving Throws and attack rolls for 1 turn). A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage and negates the Doom effect. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead take double damage.
