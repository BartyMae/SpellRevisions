Mental Domination   
(Enchantment/Charm)  
  
Level: 4  
Sphere: Thought   
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: 8 rounds  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: 1 creature   
Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
When cast upon a subject, the subject must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty in order to avoid the priest entering &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; mind. The effects of this spell are similar to those of the wizard spell Domination, with a few minor differences. Most notably, this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell's duration. To control the subject, the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. This control will last until dispelled or for the duration of the spell.
