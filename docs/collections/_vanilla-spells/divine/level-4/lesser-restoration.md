When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster. The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will likely require rest immediately after the casting, as it will cause days' worth of fatigue almost instantaneously.
