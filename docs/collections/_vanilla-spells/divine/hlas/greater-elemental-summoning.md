Druids, having a more powerful link to the elements, can cast a stronger version of Elemental Summoning. This spell can summon the Elemental Princes themselves, randomly chosen from earth, air, or fire. The Elemental Prince of Air is Chan, the Elemental Prince of Earth is Sunnis, and the Elemental Prince of Fire is Zaaman Rul. The Elemental Princes stay for 1 turn and will obey the caster as long as they remain summoned.
