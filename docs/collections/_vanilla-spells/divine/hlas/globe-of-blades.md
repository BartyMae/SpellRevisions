The priest employs this spell to set up a globe of razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, creating a dangerous barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the blade barrier suffers 10d10 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a Saving Throw vs. Spell at -2. If this is successful, the blades are avoided and no damage is suffered. The barrier remains for 1 turn.
