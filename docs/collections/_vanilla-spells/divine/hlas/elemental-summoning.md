Drawing power from the environment, this spell summons 2 16-HD elementals randomly chosen from earth, air, or fire. The elementals stay for 1 turn and will obey the caster as long as they remain summoned. There is a 10% chance that a randomly chosen Elemental Prince will be summoned instead. The Elemental Princes rule over other elementals in their respective planes. The Elemental Prince of Air is Chan, the Elemental Prince of Earth is Sunnis, and the Elemental Prince of Fire is Zaaman Rul.
