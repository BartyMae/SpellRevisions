When the caster utters the words to this powerful spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; calls upon powerful forces indeed. These forces pull down meteors from above, hurling them randomly at anyone in the area of effect. Anyone caught in the destructive path of the meteors—whether friend or foe—will suffer 4d10 points of damage with no Saving Throw. The caster is well advised to be careful in &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; use of this spell.
