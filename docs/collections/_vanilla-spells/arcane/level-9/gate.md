By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer-planar creature—the pit fiend—to attack &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; foes as well as &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self, if &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt;'s not careful. The caster must use a Protection From Evil spell on &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self (and comrades) to keep the devil from noticing &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. If the caster fails to protect &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self in this manner, the pit fiend will tear the caster and &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; companions apart piece by piece, then feast on the remains.
