Spell Trap  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 9  
Range: 0  
Duration: 18 rounds  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: The caster   
Saving Throw: None   
  
This powerful spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap—making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if a wizard shields &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self with Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; gets three spell levels back—&lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will regain one spell up to 3rd level in power.   
  
The spell trap provides 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.
