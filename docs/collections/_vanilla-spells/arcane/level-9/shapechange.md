Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: The caster  
Saving Throw: None   
  
With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of a powerful creature (mind flayer, iron golem, greater wolfwere, earth elemental, fire elemental, or giant troll). The spellcaster becomes the creature &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; wishes and has almost all of its abilities. Thus, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; can change into a mind flayer to stun &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; opponents and then become an earth elemental to crush &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; foes. These creatures have whatever Hit Points the wizard had at the time of the shapechange. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.
