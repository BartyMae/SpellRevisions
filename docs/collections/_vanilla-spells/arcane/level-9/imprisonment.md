Imprisonment  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 9  
Range: Touch   
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None   
  
When the Imprisonment spell is cast and the victim is touched, the recipient is entombed in a state of suspended animation in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The victim remains there unless a reverse of the spell—Freedom—is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists; rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will reappear exactly where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. There is no Saving Throw.
