Freedom  
(Abjuration)   
  
Level: 9  
Range: Special   
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: Special   
Saving Throw: None   
  
NOTE: Cast this spell in an area where you know someone is imprisoned, and they will be released.  
  
This is the reverse of the spell Imprisonment. When a creature is imprisoned, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trapped in a sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. If this spell is cast in the area where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was imprisoned, it will instantly free &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; will reappear exactly where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was standing when &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was imprisoned. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes.
