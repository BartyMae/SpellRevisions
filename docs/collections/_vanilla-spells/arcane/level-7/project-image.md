Project Image  
(Illusion/Phantasm)  
  
Level: 7  
Range: 0  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: The caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When this spell is cast, an illusionary copy of the caster steps out of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; body. This copy has the same Hit Points and can cast the same spells, as the original caster; however, it may not make any physical attacks. As long as the image is in existence, the original caster is rooted to the ground and only &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; projected image may move around; if the image is destroyed, the spell ends and the original caster can move again. Also, if during this time the caster takes any damage, the image will disappear and the caster can move around again. Otherwise, the image will remain for the duration of the spell, or until affected by a Dispel Magic or anything that reveals illusions, such as True Sight.
