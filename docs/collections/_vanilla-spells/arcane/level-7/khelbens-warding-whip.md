When this spell is cast, it dispels one spell protection of up to 8th level affecting the target creature. Every round thereafter till the duration of the spell expires, another spell protection will be removed from the target. The spells affected by Khelben's Warding Whip are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, and Spell Shield. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
