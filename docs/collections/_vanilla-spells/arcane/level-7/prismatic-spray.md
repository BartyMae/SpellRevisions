When casting this spell, the wizard causes seven shimmering multicolored rays of light to flash from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hand, portraying all colors of the visible spectrum. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck by a ray is blinded for 5 rounds, regardless of any other effect. All creatures caught within the area of effect will be touched by 1 or 2 of the rays, each of which has a different power and purpose:  
  
  Red — Inflicts 20 points of damage; Save vs. Spell for half.  
  Orange — Inflicts 40 points of damage; Save vs. Spell for half.  
  Yellow — Inflicts 80 points of damage; Save vs. Spell for half.  
  Green — Save vs. Poison or die; survivors take 20 points of poison damage.  
  Blue — Save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone.  
  Indigo — Save vs. Wand or be feebleminded.  
  Violet — Save vs. Spell or be disintegrated.
