(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 7  
Range: Visual range of the caster   
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 5

Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
The Finger of Death spell snuffs out the victim's life force. The caster points &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; finger at the victim after the incantation is complete, effectively ripping the life out of its body unless a Save vs. Spell is made with a -2 penalty. A creature that successfully saves still receives 2d8+1 points of damage.
