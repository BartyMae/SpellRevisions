The Control Undead spell allows the caster to take control of undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 3 Hit Dice or less, then there is no Saving Throw allowed; however, if they have 4 Hit Dice or more, a Save vs. Spell is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under the control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a Dispel Magic.
