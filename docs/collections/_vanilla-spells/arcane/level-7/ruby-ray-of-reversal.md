When this spell is cast, it dispels one spell protection of any level affecting the target creature. The spells affected by Ruby Ray Of Reversal are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
