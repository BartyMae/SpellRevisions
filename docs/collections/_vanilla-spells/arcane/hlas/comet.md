This spell is a more powerful and specialized version of Meteor Swarm. A huge meteor or comet strikes the earth, damaging all enemies in its path and sending out a powerful shockwave that knocks away all foes in the area of effect. Those knocked down must save vs. Paralysis or be stunned for 3 rounds. The comet itself does 10d10 fire damage with no save.  
  
This spell will not harm party members.
