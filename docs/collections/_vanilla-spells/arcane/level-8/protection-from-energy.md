Protection From Energy  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 8  
Range: Touch  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 8  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When the spell is cast, it confers 75% immunity against all energy attacks—such as fire, cold, acid, magic, and electricity, whether from magical or non-magical sources—such as spells, weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. This excludes any physical attacks and spell-created weapons, such as Enchanted Weapon and Spiritual Hammer. In other words, any physical damage, such as piercing, crushing, or slashing will get through. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
