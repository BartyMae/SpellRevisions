This spell causes a giant disembodied hand to squeeze and constrict the target once per round for up to 4 rounds. It initially smashes the target for 3d6 damage with no save, and the target is held. In the second round, the target can save vs. Paralysis at -2 to escape. If they fail to save, the hand does 4d6 damage. The following round, the target can save vs. Paralysis with no penalty. If they make the save, they are free to move, if they fail, the spell does 6d6 damage and holds them for 2 rounds. After the 4th round, the spell is finished. Magic Resistance will stop the spell.
