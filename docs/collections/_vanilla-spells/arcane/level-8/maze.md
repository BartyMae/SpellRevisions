Maze  
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 8  
Range: Touch   
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature   
Saving Throw: None  
  
An extradimensional space is brought into being upon utterance of a maze spell. The subject vanishes into the shifting labyrinth of force planes for a period of time that is totally dependent upon its Intelligence.  
  
Intelligence of Target    —    Time trapped in maze  
         under 3                —            2d4 turns  
         3 to 5                   —            1d4 turns  
         6 to 8                   —            5d4 rounds  
         9 to 11                 —            4d4 rounds  
         12 to 14               —            3d4 rounds  
         15 to 17               —            2d4 rounds  
         18 and up            —           1d4 rounds  
  
Note that if the 9th-level spell Freedom is cast in the area where a creature is mazed, it will effectively bring &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; back to this plane, ending the spell prematurely. Note that a mazed creature is not freed through Dispel Magic.
