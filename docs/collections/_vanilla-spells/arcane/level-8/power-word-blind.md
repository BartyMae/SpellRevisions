When a Power Word, Blind spell is cast, one or more creatures within the area of effect become sightless. The spellcaster selects one creature as the target center, and the effect spreads outward from the center, affecting all within a 4-ft. radius. This lasts for 6 rounds or until dispelled. All of the effects of blindness apply to the victims, such as a penalty to hit and to AC. The visibility range of the afflicted character is also decreased.
