This spell allows a wizard to store spells in a magical ability (accessed via the Special Ability button) that is created by the spell. This item, the trigger, can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 6th level or lower. A wizard can only possess one spell trigger at a time, and the trigger may not be given to other characters. Once the spell trigger is used, the icon will disappear from the Special Ability button.
