A duplicate of the caster is created with this spell. The duplicate is almost identical to the caster, making it a very powerful ally. It is created at 60% of the caster's level and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level. It also has 60% of the caster's Hit Points and is fully under &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; control.
