When this spell is cast, it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. The target's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. Next, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. For example, if this spell was cast by a 15th-level wizard, the target creature would lose 25% Magic Resistance from its current total, reducing it to 0 if less than that remains, as well as canceling one spell protection if the Mage currently has one. The list of spells that this includes: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap. Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. It cannot be dispelled.
