This is the combat version of Dispel Magic; it will only affect opponents. A Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the original caster, &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.  
  
Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.
