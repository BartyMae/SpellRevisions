This spell creates several small globes of fire, one for each experience level the wizard has obtained, which are held in the wizard's hands in place of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; usual weapons. The meteors can be hurled at targets up to 270 feet away and are treated as missiles with a +5 bonus to the attack rolls. Each meteor bursts into a 1-ft. diameter sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4+3 points of damage plus an additional 3 points of fire damage to any creature struck. The wizard may hurl up to five missiles per round.
