Lightning Bolt  
(Evocation)   
  
Level: 3  
Range: 70 ft.  
Duration: Instant   
Casting Time: 3   
Area of Effect: Path of bolt  
Saving Throw: 1/2  
  
Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). If the lightning bolt intersects with a wall, it will bounce until it reaches its full length.
