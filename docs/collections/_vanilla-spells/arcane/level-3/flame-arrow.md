This spell enables the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). All of the bolts will streak toward the target of the spell.
