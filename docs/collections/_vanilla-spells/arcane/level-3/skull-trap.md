Skull Trap  
(Necromancy)  
  
Level: 3  
Range: 60 ft.  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 11-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: 1/2  
  
When this spell is cast, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 8 ft. of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes damaging everyone within a 11-ft. radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d6 per level of the caster, or half with a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party lest they set it off accidentally.
