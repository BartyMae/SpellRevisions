Detect Illusion  
(Divination)  
  
Level: 3  
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When cast at a point designated by the wizard, this spell will cancel all Illusion/Phantasm spells of 3rd level and lower in the area. Spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, and Non-Detection. It is important to note that the caster can control just who this spell affects. Therefore, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party. The area of effect is roughly a 15-ft. radius around the target. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.
