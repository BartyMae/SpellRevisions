Protection From Fire  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 3  
Range: Touch  
Duration: 1 turn/level  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell lasts 1 turn per caster level. When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and to exposure to magical fires (fiery dragon breath, hell hound or pyrohydra breath, spells such as Burning Hands, Fireball, Fire Seeds, Fire Storm, Flame Strike, Meteor Swarm, and so on), absorbing 50% of all the damage dealt by such magical sources.
