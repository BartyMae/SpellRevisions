Vampiric Touch

Level: 3  
Range: Touch  
Duration: Instant   
Casting Time: 3   
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None   
  
When this spell is cast, the target loses 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for a 12th-level caster. These Hit Points are added to the caster's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points last for 1 hour.  
  
Note: This spell may not be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's Hit Points. The caster must wait for the first Vampiric Touch spell to run its course before casting another.
