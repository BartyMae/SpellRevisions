By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were field plate armor (AC 2). It is cumulative with Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield's bonus. The Ghost Armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration expires.
