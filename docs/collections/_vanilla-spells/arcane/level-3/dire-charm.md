Dire Charm  
(Enchantment/Charm)  
  
Level: 3  
Range: 60 ft.  
Duration: 5 rounds  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Neg.   
  
This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with one difference: There is no Saving Throw bonus. Dire Charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.  
  
If the spell's recipient fails &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throw, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.  
  
If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed person, the Dire Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is charmed.
