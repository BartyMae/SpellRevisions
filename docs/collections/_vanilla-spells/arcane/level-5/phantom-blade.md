Phantom Blade  
(Evocation)  
  
Level: 5  
Range: 0  
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. The silent, blade-shaped construct's cutting edges inflict damage just as those of a real sword do. The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with it, at &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; normal THAC0.  
  
The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of to-hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. However, due to its etheric nature, it causes an extra +10 damage against undead creatures. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
