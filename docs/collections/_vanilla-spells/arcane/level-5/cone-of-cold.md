When this spell is cast, it generates a cone-shaped area of extreme cold originating at the wizard's hand and extending outward in a cone 18 ft. long with a 90-deg. arc. It drains heat and causes 1d4+1 points of damage per level of the caster. For example, a 10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold causing 10d4+10 points of damage.
