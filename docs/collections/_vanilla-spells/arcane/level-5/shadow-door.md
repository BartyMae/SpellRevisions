By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell's duration. A True Seeing spell, a Gem of Seeing, or similar magical means can reveal the wizard.
