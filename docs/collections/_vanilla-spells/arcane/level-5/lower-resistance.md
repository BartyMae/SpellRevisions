Lower Resistance  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 5  
Range: 40 ft.  
Duration: 9 rounds + 1 round/level after 9th  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When cast upon a target creature, this spell will lower the Magic Resistance of this creature by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. There is no Saving Throw, and the target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell. For example, if a creature has 60% Magic Resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th-level Mage, then the target's Magic Resistance would be lowered by 25% automatically. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell: If Lower Resistance was cast upon the same creature again, the creature's Magic Resistance would be 60% - 25% (initial casting) - 25% (current casting), which would leave the creature with 10% Magic Resistance. This spell will last until its duration expires and cannot be dispelled.
