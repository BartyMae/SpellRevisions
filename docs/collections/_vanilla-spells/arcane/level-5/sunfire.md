Range: 0  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 3  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

A Sunfire is like a Fireballâ€”an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the caster: 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 15d6. The wizard gestures with &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; hand, and the entire area around &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; erupts in flames, striking everyone except the caster &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self. Creatures failing their Saving Throws take full damage from the blast; those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each taking half damage.
