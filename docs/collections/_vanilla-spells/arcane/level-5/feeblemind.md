Feeblemind  
(Enchantment/Charm)  
  
Level: 5  
Range: 40 ft.  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
Feeblemind causes the subject's intellect to degenerate into that of a simple beast of burden unless a Saving Throw vs. Spell is made with a -2 penalty. Upon a failed Saving Throw, the subject remains in this state until a successful Dispel Magic is cast upon &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;.
