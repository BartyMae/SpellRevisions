The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th-level spell Confusion in all respects. The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking either friend or foe. If the victim is 4th level or lower, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; does not receive a Saving Throw vs. the effects. However, if the victim is 5th level or higher, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; receives a Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty. The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful Dispel Magic is cast.
