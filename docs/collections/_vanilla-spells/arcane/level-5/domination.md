Domination  
(Enchantment/Charm)  
  
Level: 5  
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: 8 rounds  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The target is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.
