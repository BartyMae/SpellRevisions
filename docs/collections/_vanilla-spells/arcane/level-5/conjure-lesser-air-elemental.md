A wizard who casts a Conjure Lesser Air Elemental spell summons an air elemental to do &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; bidding. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell's duration expires, or the elemental dies. However, every time this spell is cast, there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster, go berserk, and attack the wizard who dared summoning it. If it can't reach the summoner, it will fight its way toward &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. This berserking elemental will also remain until slain or the spell's duration expires. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. At the end of this time, if the caster has won, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has control of the elemental; however, if &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. This does not prevent the use of other charm-type spells after the contest was lost. If charm spells are used before the contest is over, they will have no effect on the outcome.
