Cloudkill  
(Evocation)  
  
Level: 5  
Range: 40 ft.  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly, yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice, and causes creatures with 5 to 6 Hit Dice to roll Saving Throws vs. Poison with a -4 penalty or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.
