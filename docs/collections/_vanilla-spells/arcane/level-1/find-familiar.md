Find Familiar  
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 1  
Range: n/a  
Duration: Special  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 1 familiar  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.  
  
(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)  
  
The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.  
  
Example: A Mage has 12 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 18 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 9 Hit Points. The caster now has 21 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 9 Hit Points (putting &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; back at 12), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 18 damage.
