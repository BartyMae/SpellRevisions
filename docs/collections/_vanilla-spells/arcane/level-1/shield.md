When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard. It sets the wizard's Armor Class to 4 against all melee weapons, and 2 against missile weapons. It also grants the wizard immunity from the spell Magic Missile. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
