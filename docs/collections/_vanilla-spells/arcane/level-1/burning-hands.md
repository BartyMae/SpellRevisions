Level: 1  
Range: 0  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: The caster  
Saving Throw: 1/2  
  
When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, +2 points for each level of the caster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. Spell receive half damage.
