Grease  
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 1  
Range: 30 ft.  
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: Special  
  
A Grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.
