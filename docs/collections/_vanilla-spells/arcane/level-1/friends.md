A Friends spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 6 points of Charisma. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; and make an effort to be &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; friends and help &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; captive instead.
