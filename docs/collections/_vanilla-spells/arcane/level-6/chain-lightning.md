Chain Lightning   
(Invocation/Evocation)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: 40 ft.  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: Special   
Saving Throw: 1/2   
  
When the wizard casts Chain Lightning, arcs of electrical energy burst from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; fingertips. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies near the caster, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels of the caster. If the target of the lightning saves vs. Spell, only half damage is inflicted. Thus, a 12th-level wizard will cause 6d6 damage to a victim (3d6 if the victim makes &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throw vs. Spell).
