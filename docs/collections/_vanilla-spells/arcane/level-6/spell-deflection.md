Spell Deflection  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: 0   
Duration: 3 rounds/level  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: The caster   
Saving Throw: None   
  
This powerful abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 10 spell levels. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard, as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be absorbed. Something to note is that as long as there are levels remaining, then the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection. It is not affected by a Dispel Magic.
