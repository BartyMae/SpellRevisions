Contingency  
(Evocation)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: Permanent until triggered  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowedâ€”up to 6th-level spells at 18th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster may choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.  
  
For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.  
  
A limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster: Therefore, it may not be an offensive spell, nor may it target any other party members.
