In using this spell, the wizard points at an individual and utters the Power Word. For the next 7 rounds, that creature cannot make any sound. This silence completely foils any spells that require verbal components. The only ways to counter this spell are either a Dispel Magic or a Vocalize spell. There is no Saving Throw.
