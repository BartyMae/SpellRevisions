Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power, for when the wizard casts the spell, &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, and &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; becomes a formidable fighting machine.   
  
The spell causes the caster to become a berserk Fighter: &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Hit Points double, and all damage &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; sustains is first detracted from this magically-gained life; &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Armor Class gains a +4 bonus up to a maximum Armor Class of -10; and all &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; attacks are made as though &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; were a Fighter of the same level (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved to Fighters, although no extra attacks per round are gained). Each attack also receives a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
