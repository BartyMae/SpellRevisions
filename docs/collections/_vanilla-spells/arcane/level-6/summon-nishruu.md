By casting the Summon Nishruu spell, a wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, this boiling, churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn toward magic like a moth to the flame, the nishruu feed on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. The nishruu have no physical attacks at all, although physical attacks can hurt them. Each time a nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around him, the wizard loses 1 random spell of the highest level currently memorized. The nishruu is completely immune to magic (except for Death Spell), and magic will actually heal it. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until slain or until the spell's duration expires.
