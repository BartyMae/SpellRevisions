Protection From Magical Weapons  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: 0  
Duration: 4 rounds  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: The caster  
Saving Throw: None   
  
When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all magical weapons. This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted. The attacks of powerful monsters are also considered magical weapons. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is protected from normal weapons as well as anyone protected by Mantle, Improved Mantle, or Absolute Immunity. Due to the nature of this spell, with the short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.
