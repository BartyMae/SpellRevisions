Pierce Magic  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: 40 ft.  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When this spell is cast upon a target creature, there will be two major effects: First, the creature's Magic Resistance, if any, will be lowered by 1% per level of the caster; second, one spell protection of 8th level or lower affecting the creature, if any, will be canceled. For example, if this spell were cast by a 15th-level wizard, the target creature would lose 15% of its Magic Resistance from its current total (reducing it to 0 if less than that remains), and one 8th- or lower level spell protection affecting the creature would be dispelled. Spells affected by Pierce Magic are Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe of Invulnerability. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. Magic Resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.
