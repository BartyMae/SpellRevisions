Globe of Invulnerability  
(Abjuration)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: 0  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius sphere  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Globe of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. 5th- and higher level spells are not affected by the globe, and magical attacks of 5th-level or higher, such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic, can bring it down.
