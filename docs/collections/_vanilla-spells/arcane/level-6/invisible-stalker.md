Invisible Stalker  
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: 120 ft.  
Duration: 9 hours  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This 8-Hit-Dice monster obeys and serves the caster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 9 hours or until it is killedâ€”at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.
