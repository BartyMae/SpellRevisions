Level: 6  
Range: Visual range of the caster

Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
When this spell is cast at another creature, a thin green ray is shot out. Upon contact with the ray, the creature must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell or be transformed into dust. This transformation is instantaneous and irreversible. There is also a good chance that this will destroy some if not all of the items that the creature is carrying.
