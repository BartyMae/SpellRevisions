Flesh to Stone  
(Alteration)  
  
Level: 6  
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
This spell turns flesh of any sort to stone. All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone. The intended subject of the spell receives a Saving Throw vs. Spell to avoid the effect. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to attacks of any sort, it will shatter into tiny pieces, making it impossible for the creature to be returned to flesh. The reverse of this spell may be cast upon the victim in order to restore life, but this is the only way.
