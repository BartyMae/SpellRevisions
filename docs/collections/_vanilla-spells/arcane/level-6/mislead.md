Level: 6  
Range: 0  
Duration: 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When this spell is cast, the wizard is affected by an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; original position. Meanwhile, an exact image of the caster is created where &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; used to be, with exactly the same Hit Points as the caster. The image cannot perform any actions at all, such as attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible wizard. The image will remain under control of the caster until reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until affected by a Dispel Magic or a spell that reveals illusions, such as True Sight.
