Application of this spell sets the Strength of the character to 18 and then adds a +50% bonus on top of this. The character receives any strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 Strength, then &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a Strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Strength is less than 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's Strength if it is already 19 or more.
