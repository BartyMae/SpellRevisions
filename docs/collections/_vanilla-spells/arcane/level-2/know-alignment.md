Know Alignment  
(Divination)  
  
Level: 2  
Range: 30 ft.  
Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: 1 creature   
Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
A Know Alignment spell enables the Mage to exactly read the aura of a creature. If the creature rolls a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. When a character is hit by this spell, he will glow red if evil, green if good, and white if neutral. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Alignment spell.
