Level: 2  
Range: 90 ft.  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 2  
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: Neg.  
  
When casting a Stinking Cloud spell, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 90 ft. away from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Poison at +2 or be sent reeling and fall down for 1d2 rounds. Those who make successful Saving Throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A Dispel Magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud, then they are still subject to its effects.
