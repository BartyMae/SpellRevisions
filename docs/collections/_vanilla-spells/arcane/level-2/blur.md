When a Blur spell is cast, the wizard causes the outline of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee attacks against the caster to be made with a -3 penalty. The wizard also gains a +1 bonus to all of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Saving Throws.
