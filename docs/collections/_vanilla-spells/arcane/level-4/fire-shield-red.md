The red Fireshield protects the user from fire damage by surrounding the caster with a shield of flame. This shield does not only grant the user a 50% Fire Resistance, but also protects &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; from attacks made from within a 5-ft. radius around &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. An opponent that hits the caster with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 1d8+2 points of fire damage.
