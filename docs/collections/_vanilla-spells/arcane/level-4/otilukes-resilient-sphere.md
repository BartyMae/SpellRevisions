When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature if it fails to Save vs. Spell. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage; in fact, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful Dispel Magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time completely unable to affect the outside world.
