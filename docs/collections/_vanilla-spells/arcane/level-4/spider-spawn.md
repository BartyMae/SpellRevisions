Spider Spawn  
(Conjuration/Summoning)  
  
Level: 4  
Range: 120 ft.  
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
Upon casting this spell, the wizard must throw several spider eggs into the air while saying the final command word. The result is that the eggs morph into a fully grown spider that will remain under the wizard's telepathic control. The type of spider that appears depends upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.  
 7th: giant spider.  
 9th: phase spider.  
 12th+: sword spider.  
When the spell is cast, there is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one. These spiders will remain under the wizard's control until they are slain, or until the spell duration expires.
