When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;self, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt;, but the 6th would affect &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.
