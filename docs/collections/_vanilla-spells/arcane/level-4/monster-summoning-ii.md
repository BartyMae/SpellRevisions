Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell is much like the 3rd-level Monster Summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 4-HD monsters. There is a 60% chance of receiving one monster and a 40% chance of receiving two monsters. These monster(s) appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires or until they are slain.
