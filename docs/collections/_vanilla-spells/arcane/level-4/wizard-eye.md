When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends &lt;PRO_HIMHER&gt; visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell.
