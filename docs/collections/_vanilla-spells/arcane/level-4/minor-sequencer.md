Minor Sequencer  
(Invocation/Evocation)  
  
Level: 4  
Range: 0  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell allows a wizard to store two spells and activate them both at the same time from &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; Special Ability button. Both spells must be of 2nd level or lower. To create a sequencer, a Mage must memorize not only Minor Sequencer but also the spells &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; still has spell slots). After casting Minor Sequencer, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; has memorized.  
  
A sequencer lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Ability icon also disappears until the next time a sequencer is formed. A wizard can possess only one Minor Sequencer at a time, and it may not be given to other characters.
