Improved Invisibility  
(Illusion/Phantasm)  
  
Level: 4  
Range: Touch  
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None  
  
This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen. However, telltale traces—a shimmering—allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.  
  
Note: After making an attack, the wizard is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the wizard.
