Polymorph Self  
(Alteration)  
  
Level: 4  
Range: 0  
Duration: 1 turn + 3 rounds/level  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: The caster  
Saving Throw: None  
  
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. The caster also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. This spell does not give the new form's other abilities, such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.  
  
For the duration of the spell, the caster can transform into any of the new forms at any time and as many times as &lt;PRO_HESHE&gt; wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, but all physical attributes are obtained from the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and crushing weapons possessed by the slime form.  
  
The possible forms given by Polymorph Self are:  
– Flind: wields a magical halberd (+1 fire damage and strikes as a +3 weapon)  
– Mustard Jelly: capable of poisoning or slowing opponents (if they fail a Save vs. Death when hit)  
– Ogre: Capable of causing massive damage  
– Spider: Causes poison damage when it hits an opponent  
  
In addition, the caster may choose the form of brown bear, black bear, or wolf.
