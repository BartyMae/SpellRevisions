The blue Fireshield protects the user from cold damage by surrounding the caster with a shield of ice flame. This shield not only grants the user 50% Cold Resistance, but also protects the caster from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius around the caster. An opponent that hits the caster with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 1d8+2 cold damage.
