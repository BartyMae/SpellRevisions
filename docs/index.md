Welcome to the documentation for Spell Revisions, an Infinity Engine mod created by Demivrgvs.

Spell Revisions aims to fix, tweak, and enhance arcane and divine spells in Baldur's Gate II, Tutu, Baldur's Gate Trilogy, BG:EE, and BGII:EE. This originally started as a project to make the spell system more balanced by improving weaker spells and nerfing overpowered ones, but has evolved to also include changes to spells designed to make them more fun and interesting and fixes for spell-related bugs found in the original game.

The mod places a high priority on making all of the existing spells viable choices, while keeping an eye on balance issues. Now, Magic Missile won't be the only first-level arcane spell you'll want to memorize! To help achieve this goal, portions of the old spell system that were consistently underpowered, like healing spells and summons, have been vastly improved so that they are competitive options once more. In addition, SR takes the stance that low-level spells should not become completely inffective once characters reach higher levels, and adds scaling features to many spells.

Among other things, the mod makes druid and cleric spell selections more distinct, with druids focusing on animal and elemental spheres for a repertoire of spells oriented toward the offensive. Arcane spell schools have also been flushed out, with the belief that each spell level should contain at least one spell from each school. To help fulfill these goals, SR adds a small number of spells to the game and modifies the schools and restrictions of some existing spells where appropriate.

SR also improves the descriptions of many spells to be more accurate, more consistent, and, occasionally, less boring.
