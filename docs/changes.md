## Descriptions

Descriptions for all spells have been updated. Now, you can be sure that what you read is what you get (well, maybe 95% sure). Descriptions are constructed in the following manner:

```
<Name>
<Level>
<School>
<Sphere>
  Listed only in divine spells
<Range>
  Personal - area of effect is centered on the caster
  Touch    - same as the range of one-handed weapons
  Short    - 1/3 the visual range of the caster
  Medium   - 2/3 the visual range of the caster
  Long     - visual range of the caster, the longest that the game allows
<Duration>
  BG2 uses the following units:
  1 round => 6 seconds
  1 turn  = 10 rounds
  1 hour  = 5 turns
<Casting Time>
  1 = fastest
  9 = 1 round = slowest
<Area of Effect>
  Caster     - spell affects the caster only
  1 creature - spell affects any one creature
  X' radius  - spell affects creatures in the given radius
               (50 feet is almost equal to visual range of caster)
  Cone       - spell has a cone-shaped area of effect
<Saving Throw>
  X Half    - making a successful save vs. X reduces damage by half
  X Partial - making a successful save vs. X results in a reduced effect
  X Negates - making a successful save vs. X results in no effect
  None      - there is no saving throw against this spell
  Special   - the spell has multiple saving throws, different targets roll
              different saving throws, etc.
